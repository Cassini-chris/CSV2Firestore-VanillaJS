#### In more detail:
The app works by first allowing the user to select a CSV file to upload. Once the file has been selected, the app will parse the file and create a new collection (called "collection-name") in the Cloud Firestore database. The data from the CSV file will then be inserted into the new collection. The app also provides a preview of the data in the CSV file before it is uploaded.
